Wherever there is conflict, or where a group strives together for a common goal, they follow leaders whose perspective enables them to best apply their efforts. On the frontlines of the battlefield, frontier or the dungeon, these are the tacticians. Their quick thinking, timely commands, and trusted retainers are a vital asset for any group who finds their mettle tested.

## Fighting Style
*1st-level Tactician Feature*

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

**Archery**
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

**Combat Technician**
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. They count as tactician spells for you, and Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.

**Defense**
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

**Dueling**
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

**Great Weapon Fighting**
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

**Protection**
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

**Two-Weapon Fighting**
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

**Blind Fighting**  
You have [blindsight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Blindsight) with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you’re [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible) creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

**Interception**  
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

**Thrown Weapon Fighting**  
You can draw a weapon that has the [thrown](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties) property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.

In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

## Command Shouts
*1st-level Tactician Feature*

The powerful voice of the tacticians cuts clearly through the din of battle, reaching their allies to empower and embolden them. Tacticians tap into a sort of universal power akin to that of bardic magic which connects themselves and their allies through their shouted commands.

The following abilities are command shouts which can be activated as a bonus action on your turn. Unless otherwise stated, each one affects allies within 25 feet of you who can both see and hear you. You can use these abilities a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all uses of them upon completing a short or long rest.

At 1st level, you learn two of these shouts. You learn another shout at every odd level (3rd, 5th, 7th, and so on). In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class you can unlearn a known shout and exchange it for another. The standard command shouts follow, in no particular order:

**Hold the line!** 
You charge your allies with the defense of a particular line or area. Affected creatures gain the benefits of the Sentinel feat for up to 1 minute or until they make an attack enabled by the feat.

**Make haste!**
You drive your allies to move with greater urgency. Until the beginning of your next turn, affected creatures gain the benefits of the Mobile feat.

**Steel yourselves!**
You prepare your allies to engage in combat. For 1 minute, affected creatures gain temporary hit points equal to your Tactician level plus your Proficiency Bonus.

**Take cover!**
You warn your allies of incoming danger and urge them to seek cover. Affected creatures may expend their reaction, if they have it, to move up to 10 feet to be adjacent to any object, structure, or terrain feature large enough to grant them any amount of cover in any direction.

**Scatter!**
You prepare your allies to dodge an incoming area attack. Until the beginning of your next turn, affected creatures get a bonus to their Dexterity saving throws equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

**Charge!**
You raise the fury in your allies and exhort them to charge the enemy! Affected creatures gain the benefits of the Charger feat for until the beginning of your next turn or until they make an attack enabled by the feat.

**Hold fast!**
You demand that your allies cling to their purpose or will to survive and remain focused on the task at hand. For the next minute, affected creatures get a bonus to saving throws made to resist becoming **frightened**, or made to recover from being **frightened**.

**Stand tall!**
You call to allies to prepare themselves to bring all their strength to bear. For up to 1 minute or until they succeed on a Strength ability check, skill check, or saving throw, affected creatures get a bonus to Strength ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

**Shake it off!**
Your shout reaches a deep place in the psyche of your allies, steadying their beaten nerves. Affected creatures recover from the **stunned** or the **incapacitated** condition (but not **paralyzed**), if they have either of them.

**Snap out of it!**
Your shout brings misdirected allies back to reality. Affected creatures recover from the **charmed**, **confused**, and **frightened** conditions, if they have any of them.

**Strike as one!**
You rally your allies into synchronizing their strikes. Until the beginning of your next turn, affected creatures can use their reaction to make a melee attack against a creature within range whenever an ally successfull hits that creature with an attack.

**Fight together!**
You guide your allies to work together to time their attacks against their opponents. For 1 minute, affected creatures gain the benefits of the **pack tactics** ability (the same as on the *Wolf* stat block).

**Take aim!**
You direct allies launching ranged attacks to hone their focus. For up to 1 minute or until they take advantage of this bonus, affected creatures can choose to reroll up to one damage die rolled as part of a successful ranged attack.

**Finish it!**
You urge your allies to end the battle decisively. For up to 1 minute or until they land a critical hit, affected creatures have their critical threat range increased by one. For example, a creature which normally lands a critical hit on a roll of natural 20 would instead land a critical hit on a natural roll of 19-20. A creature which already landed a critical on 19-20 would do so on 18-20, and so on.

## Cadre
*2nd level Tactician feature*

Tacticians typically surround themselves with other characters, retainers, soldiers, and hirelings who can help them achieve their objectives. In game terms, tacticians can accommodate sidekicks (as in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*) and other characters whom they can issue orders to outside of combat and command directly in combat, as long as they remain allies.

The number of such characters who can follow a tactician begins with 1 at 2nd level, and increases by 1 with every 5 levels thereafter of the tactician (1 at 2nd level, 2 at 7th, 3 at 12th, and 4 at 17th). It's suggested that these characters, if using the Sidekick rules from *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, begin at a level roughly 3/4 or 2/3 that of the tactician they follow. It's up to the Game Master to  decide and enact how these followers gain levels. Additionally, if using the Sidekick rules from *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, a tactician's first sidekick must be of the Warrior archetype. Access to followers of other specific Sidekick archetypes is granted as a feature of the various Tactician Creeds.

It's important that the use of this class, and this feature, in particular involve a conversation with the Game Master about how such followers are gained and utilized by tactician characters, as their impact on some game mechanics have potential to be abused. On the other side of the coin, a player without their expectations set around how well they can command or control a direct follower might find it frustrating if their GM doesn't allow them to have or control access to this class feature in the way they wanted.

## Spellcasting
*2nd level Tactician feature*

Tacticians' use of their voice taps into a deeper power than simply communicating with their allies, exhorting reality itself. Through manipulation of this, they can achieve effects wondrous effects that take the form of magic spells. 

#### Spell Slots

The Tactician table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your tactician spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the tactician spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Tactician table shows when you learn more tactician spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tactician spells you know and replace it with another spell from the tactician spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your tactician spells, since your magic draws on your tactical acumen and applied use of your voice to direct allies. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tactician spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

## Creed
*3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level Tactician feature*

At 3rd level, you choose a creed of tactics which you adhere to. The standard set of creeds are detailed later in the *Tactician Creeds* section. Your chosen creed grants you additional class features at levels 3, 7, 11, and 15.

## Ability Score Increase
*4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level Tactician feature*

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

## Calculated Strikes
*5th level Tactician Feature*

When you attack with a weapon with the *finesse* trait, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

## Extra Attack
*5th level Tactician Feature*

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack)action on your turn.

## Dauntless
*6th level Tactician Feature*

When you reach 6th level, your commitment to your allies and followers steels your nerves. You become immune to the *frightened* condition.

## Maestro
*10th level Tactician Feature*

When you reach 10th level, your heightened awareness in combat and other tight situations allows you to direct allies to act beyond their normal limits. As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct an ally within 60 feet whose presence you are aware of to take any of the following actions: attack, cast a cantrip they know, dodge, disengage, hide, help, ready (though not to cast any spells of 1st level or higher), search, or use an object. That ally must consent to the action you direct them to perform, and doing so consumes their reaction.

## Cadre Training
*10th, 14th, and 18th level Tactician Feature*

When you reach 10th level, continued training with your sidekick followers allows you to dedicate that training to specific talents in order to make those companions more effective and enable specialized tactics. The next time you complete a long rest, you may have one of your sidekick followers gain a feat that they meet the prerequisites for.

You may have another sidekick follower gain a feat that they meet the prerequisites for again when you reach level 14 in this class, and again at level 18. Each sidekick follower can only gain one feat from this feature. If one of your sidekicks who has gained a feat from this feature dies or leaves your service permanently, you can choose another to gain a feat in replacement for the one that left.

## Adaptable Commander
*14th level Tactician Feature*

At 14th level, your experience allows you to learn to adapt to the capabilities of your followers, regardless of what those capabilities are. You become able to recruit and command sidekicks of whichever varieties you haven't already been able to recruit. For example, if you could already recruit warriors and experts, you become able to recruit spellcasters. If you could already recruit warriors and a type of spellcaster, you become able to recruit experts and the other types of spellcaster.

## Coordinated Superiority
*20th level Tactician Feature*

At the peak of your career as a tactician, you can direct your allies so well that they can perform and coordinate flawlessly for brief windows of time. When you use any of your command shouts, you can choose to activate this ability in addition to that shout's effects. For up to 1 minute or until they take advantage of this bonus, allies affected by your command shout can do one of the following:
- When missing with an attack roll, choose to turn the roll into a success instead
- When failing an ability check, skill check, or saving throw, choose to instead succeed in that check or saving throw
- When causing another creature or object to make a saving throw, choose to have them automatically fail it. In this case the character must decide to use this option before knowing if their target succeeded with its rolled attempt at the saving throw. Legendary resistances can still be expended by creatures that have them to succeed at saving throws in spite of this effect.

You can use this ability twice, and regain all uses of it after completing a long rest.

Allies you direct in combat engage carefully so as to avoid taking unnecessary risks. Whenever you use any of your Command Shouts, affected allies also gain the Uncanny Dodge feature (the same as the Rogue class feature) for up to 1 minute or until they take advantage of this bonus.

### Leading Strike
*15th level Guerilla Leader feature*

You lead by example to bring down priority targets. When you hit a creature with an attack, you can choose to mark it as a target for your allies until the beginning of your next turn. Allies hitting the marked target with weapons or spells deal an additional amount of damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus. That additional damage is of the same type as that dealt by the weapon or spell used.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and regain all uses of it upon completing a long rest.
